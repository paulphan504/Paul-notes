**[Connecting to the Console Port with Mac OS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/connectedgrid/cgr1000/hardware/cgr1120/installation/app-console.pdf)**
This procedure describes how to connect a Mac OS X system USB port to the console using the built-in OS X Terminal
utility.
1. Use the Finder to go to Applications > Utilities > Terminal.
2. Connect the OS X USB port to the router.
3. Enter the following commands to find the OS X USB port number:

`macbook:user$ ``cd /dev

`macbook:user$ ``ls -ltr /dev/*usb*

`crw-rw-rw- 1 root wheel 9, 66 Apr 1 16:46 tty.usbmodem1a21

DT-macbook:dev user$

4. Connect to the USB port with the following command followed by the router USB port speed:

`macbook:user$ ``screen /dev/tty.usbmodem1a21 9600

To Disconnect the OS X USB Console from the Terminal Window

Enter Ctrl+A followed by Ctrl+\

[How to configure ASDM on ASA](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/adaptive-security-device-manager/116403-configure-asdm-00.html)
 **ASDM Image in Flash**

Make sure that the required version of the ASDM is uploaded to the flash. It can either be uploaded with the currently run version of the ASDM or with other conventional methods of file transfer to the ASA, such as TFTP.

Enter **show flash** on the ASA CLI in order to help you list the files present on the ASA flash memory. Check for the presence of the ASDM file:

`ciscoasa# **show flash**
`` --#--  --length--  -----date/time------  path

 `249  76267       Feb 28 2013 19:58:18  startup-config.cfg
 `250  4096        May 12 2013 20:26:12  sdesktop
 `251  15243264    May 08 2013 21:59:10  asa823-k8.bin
 `252  25196544    Mar 11 2013 22:43:40  asa845-k8.bin
 `253  17738924    Mar 28 2013 00:12:12  asdm-702.bin    ---- ASDM Image

In order to further verify if the image present on the flash is valid and not corrupt, you can use the **verify** command in order to compare the stored MD5 hash in the software package and the MD5 hash of the actual file present:

`ciscoasa# **verify flash:/asdm-702.bin**  
`Verifying file integrity of disk0:/asdm-702.bin  
`!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
`Done!  
`Embedded Hash MD5: e441a5723505b8753624243c03a40980  
`Computed Hash MD5: e441a5723505b8753624243c03a40980  
`CCO Hash      MD5: c305760ec1b7f19d910c4ea5fa7d1cf1  
`Signature Verified  
`Verified disk0:/asdm-702.bin 

This step can help you verify if the image is present and its integrity on the ASA.

**ASDM Image in Use**

This process is defined under the ASDM configuration on the ASA. A sample configuration definition of the current image that is used looks like this:

```bash
asdm image disk0:/asdm-702.bin
```


In order to further verify, you can also use the **show asdm image** command:

	ciscoasa# s**how asdm image**  
	Device Manager image file, disk0:/asdm-702.bin

**HTTP Server Restrictions**

This step is essential in the ASDM configuration because it defines which networks have access to the ASA. A sample configuration looks like this:

http server enable  
http 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 inside  
  
http 10.0.0.1 255.0.0.0 outside
